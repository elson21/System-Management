# System Management

System Management is a web application that allows users to **claim a system** (e.g. a PLC, inverter, or other shared machine) while they are working on it.  
This prevents conflicts and ensures teams always know which systems are in use.

## The Problem
When a software engineer wants to test their code on a physical machine, they must ensure that no one else is using it.  
At the same time, they need to guarantee that no one else will access the machine during their session.  

Currently, teams often rely on ad-hoc solutions:
- Posting in chat channels (Teams, Slack, etc.)  
- Sending emails  
- Maintaining Excel sheets  
- Or simply talking to each other  

These approaches are inefficient and error-prone. As teams and organizations grow, it becomes easy to lose track of **who is using which system**.

## The Solution
System Management provides a centralized web application with:
- **User authentication**  
- **System claiming/locking** for a set duration  
- **Organization- and department-level visibility**  

This ensures that:
- Everyone knows when a system is in use  
- Users can confidently work without interruptions  
- Departments can coordinate access efficiently
