# System Management

This is a web application that allows a single user to claim a system, such as
a PLC or inverter, to work on without the need to announce it to the team.

### The Problem

When a software engineer wants to test their code on a physical machine, they must ensure
that no one else is using the machine. At the same time, he needs to be sure that no other person will access the machine while working on it.
Some teams use internal channels such as Teams, emails or excel spreadsheets for this purpose, while others simply talk to each other. These way have proven to be inneficient as it is easy to lose track of who is using which machine, especially as the team or organization grows.

### The Solution

A web application with user authentication that enables users to lock a machine for a specified amount of time without the need to inform each person or a group of people.
This way multiple departments will be aware at all times when a machine is not available and refrain from accessing it.
